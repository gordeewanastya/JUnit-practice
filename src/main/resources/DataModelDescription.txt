Employee time tracking:
    - Employee (id, firstName, lastName, department, jobTitle)
    - Presence (date, timeIn, timeOut, employee)
    - WorkDaySummary (employee, date, presences)

1) class Employee -> contains info about an employee

    Integer id
    String firstName
    String lastName
    String department
    String jobTitle

    Method String getFullName() -> returns firstName and lastName together as one string
        So the method should return result of concatenation firstName + " " + lastName

    Method boolean isValid() -> checks whether firstName and lastName are not blank and not null
        Method returns true, if conditions that these string are not blank and not null
        Method returns false, otherwise

2) class Presence -> contains info about time when employee started and then ended work, on concrete day

    LocalDate date
    LocalDateTime timeIn
    LocalDateTime timeOut
    Employee employee

    Method Duration getDuration() -> returns duration of employee's presence at work
        Method returns the duration between timeIn and timeOut in case both are valid
        Otherwise return Duration.ZERO

    Method boolean isValid() -> checks whether timeIn and timeOut are not null, and timeOut is greater than timeIn

3) class WorkDaySummary -> contains a list of all presences of an employee during the day and can calculate total worked time

    Employee employee
    LocalDate date
    List<Presence> presences

    Method Duration getTotalWorkedTime() -> returns total worked time during the concrete day
        Sums up all the durations from the presences list and returns the sum of working hours


    Method boolean hasIncompleteRecords() -> checks whether there are invalid or incomplete presence records
        Returns true if any presence record is invalid or incomplete
        Returns false if all presence records are valid

    Method void addPresence(Presence presence) -> used to add presence to the list
        Checks whether presence is not null and is the same date as this workDaySummary.date, then adds it to the list
